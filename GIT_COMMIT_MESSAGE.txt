feat: implement APEG Phases 4-5 (OpenAI integration and domain agents)

This commit delivers substantial progress on the APEG autonomous implementation:

## Phase 4: Workflow Orchestrator & OpenAI Integration - COMPLETE ✅

### OpenAI Connector (src/apeg_core/connectors/openai_client.py)
- Test mode support via APEG_TEST_MODE environment variable
- Automatic fallback when API key missing or openai unavailable
- Full chat completion interface with structured responses
- 5 passing tests (test_openai_client.py)

### Workflow Executor Utilities (src/apeg_core/workflow/executor.py)
- validate_workflow_graph(): Comprehensive validation with detailed errors
- get_next_node(): Conditional edge traversal with default fallback
- get_node_by_id(), get_entry_point(), get_outgoing_edges()
- 22 passing tests (test_workflow_executor.py)

### Orchestrator Enhancement (src/apeg_core/orchestrator.py)
- Added _call_agent() method for agent routing with role-specific prompts
- Integrated agent calling into "build" node workflow
- Resolved TODO[APEG-PH-4] placeholder
- Supports all 7 agent roles (PEG, ENGINEER, VALIDATOR, etc.)

## Phase 5: Domain Agents - SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE ✅

### Base Agent Framework (src/apeg_core/agents/)
- Enhanced BaseAgent with execute(), name property, test_mode support
- Created agent_registry.py with full registration system:
  * register_agent(), get_agent(), list_agents()
  * Global AGENT_REGISTRY for dynamic instantiation
  * Auto-registration of domain agents on import

### Shopify Agent (src/apeg_core/agents/shopify_agent.py)
- Added execute() method with 3 test-mode actions
- product_sync, inventory_check, seo_analysis
- Raises NotImplementedError for real API (Phase 8)
- Marked as APEG-AGENT-001 placeholder

### Etsy Agent (src/apeg_core/agents/etsy_agent.py)
- Added execute() method with 3 test-mode actions
- listing_sync, inventory_management, shop_stats
- Raises NotImplementedError for real API (Phase 8)
- Marked as APEG-AGENT-002 placeholder

## Documentation

### Created
- docs/APEG_PLACEHOLDERS.md (updated): Tracks all placeholders
- IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md: Comprehensive progress report

### Updated
- Resolved APEG-PH-4 (agent calling integration)
- Added APEG-CONN-001, APEG-AGENT-001, APEG-AGENT-002 placeholders
- Updated TODO markers throughout codebase

## Test Results
- Before: 44 passing, 1 skipped
- After: 71 passing, 1 skipped
- New tests: 27 (all passing)
- Phase 4 coverage: 100%
- Phase 5 coverage: ~30% (core framework tested, full tests pending)

## Known Gaps (to be addressed in next session)
1. HTTP tools connector (src/apeg_core/connectors/http_tools.py) - optional
2. Phase 5 complete test suite (15 tests pending)
3. Phase 6 implementation (scoring, logging, adoption gate)
4. Phase 7 implementation (CI, cleanup, documentation)

## Verification
All components tested and working in test mode:
```bash
export APEG_TEST_MODE=true
pytest tests/ -v  # 71 passing
python -c "from apeg_core.agents import get_agent; print(get_agent('shopify', test_mode=True).execute('product_sync', {}))"
```

## Next Steps
See IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md for detailed next steps and completion guide.
Estimated remaining work: 6-9 hours for Phases 5 (completion), 6, and 7.

Resolves: APEG-PH-4 (agent calling integration)
Tracks: APEG-CONN-001, APEG-AGENT-001, APEG-AGENT-002 (API placeholders)
Ready for: Phase 6 (scoring and logging integration)
