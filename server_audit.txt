Server Module Status Audit - Task 7
=========================================

Date: 2025-11-20
Task: APEG Deployment & Raspberry Pi Runbook

Findings:
---------
- server.py: MISSING - needs to be created
- api/ directory: MISSING - not required for minimal implementation
- CLI serve command: MISSING - needs to be added
- CLI files present: __main__.py, cli.py
- FastAPI dependencies: ALREADY PRESENT in requirements.txt
  - fastapi>=0.104.0 ✓
  - uvicorn[standard]>=0.24.0 ✓
  - pydantic>=2.0.0 ✓

Recommended Actions:
--------------------
1. CREATE src/apeg_core/server.py (minimal FastAPI implementation)
2. SKIP dependency addition (already present)
3. UPDATE CLI to add serve command
4. CREATE comprehensive deployment documentation
5. VERIFY server starts and responds to health checks

Start Method for Documentation:
--------------------------------
python -m apeg_core.server
(or via CLI: apeg serve - after CLI update)
